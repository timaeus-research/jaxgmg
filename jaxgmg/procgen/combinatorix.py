def enumerate_associations(n: int) -> list[tuple[int, ...]]:
    """
    Returns a list of 'associations' of length `n`, which is my name for
    sequences of `n` pairs of balanced parantheses (or many other things
    counted by the Catalan numbers).

    Actually these sequences are tuples of `n` zeros and `n` ones rather than
    `n` pairs of parentheses. The tuples satisfy the property that no prefix
    of the tuple has more ones than zeros. For example:

    ```
    >>> enumerate_associations(2)
    [
        (0, 1, 0, 1),
        (0, 0, 1, 1),
    ]
    >>> enumerate_associations(3)
    [
        (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1),
        (0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1),
        (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1),
        (0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1),
        (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1),
    ]
    
    ```

    The enumeration method is inspired by the following unambiguous grammar
    for the language of balanced parentheses:

                                S  ->  Îµ
                                S  ->  ( S ) S

    The variables 'lhs' and 'rhs' in the code correspond to the things you
    could substitute for the first and second (resp.) occurrence of the
    variable S in the second rule.

    It also traces out the way you would implement this recursive formula for
    the Catalan numbers if you were counting the balances parentheses:

        C(0) = 1
        C(k) = Sum from j=0 to k-1 of: C(j) * C(k-1-j)      for k > 0

    The first loop is to build up the recurrence from k=1 to n. The second
    loop is the sum over j. The third and fourth loops implement the product
    C(j) * C(k-1-j).

    Caveats:

    * The resulting sequences are not produced in lexicographic order, nor
      reverse lexicographic order. However, the first sequence should always
      be `(0,1,)*n` and the last should always be `(0,)*n + (1,)*n`.

    * The use of tuple concatenation could be a bottleneck for deep recurrence,
      but seems kinda unavoidable and kinda unlikely to become a problem in
      practice since the number of associations grows so rapidly in depth.
